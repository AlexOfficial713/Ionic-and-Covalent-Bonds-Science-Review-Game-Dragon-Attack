ionic: soluble in polar solvents (such as water). They also have high melting and boiling points

covalent: soluble in nonpolar solvents since they share similar electron density characteristic. They also have low boiling and melting points

Beginning task: At first you must go through two different dungeons in which in each dungeon you will create a water and lava sword.
The water sword will be created by making a water molecule and then molding a sword using those molecules. The lava sword will be obtained
by solving a pad lock which can be unlocked by solving different questions based on whether a compound is ionic or covalent.

The battle: Now that the beginning is finished a room at the top will open and once you go through you will be met by a dragon that is a hybrid
of a dragon mixed with chemical waste. The dragon will throw chemicals at the player which can be destroyed by attacking the with the lava
or water sword (Lava for covalent and Water for ionic). Using the wrong sword will result in loss of health points for the player. The player
will also have abilities (Not yet determined). That will help the player get close to the dragon and attack the dragon with the players sword.
The drogon will also switch states between ionic and covalent chemical waste in which the water or lava sword will do more damage based on the
state of the dragon.
